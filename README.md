# ccle-shiny-app

The cancer cell line encyclopedia resource. We plan to develop a shiny app resource to access genome browser and gene expression data.
For the genome browser, we leveraged St Jude's protein paint API to display big wig tracks downloaded from the recount3 server. 
Given the rich dataset from CCLE, we plan to develop a series of R script to extract CCLE mutation information followed by gene expression analysis by our previously developed application: DRPPM-EASY Expression Analysis with ShinY.

In the future, we plan to work toward developing a resource for the community to identify genetic variants and splicing events sensitive to drug treatment (PRISM) or genetic screens (DepMap).
